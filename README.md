## TODOs for Stefan

- TODO: once Website is done, search for `Lorem ipsum` and finish translation/text

## SVARGA: for me

- SVARGA: once Website is done, add locale `de`, `re`

## üìì Tasks done

> 29.8.2025

- I will create web with `sr`, `en` first, other locales likes `de`, `ru` I will do at the end, when website is finished and texts are final
  - otherwise it would be slowing me down (I already need to do 1x extra copy per text to EN, then I would need to do 3x extra)
  - taking care of `sr` texts and their translations (and keeping it in sync) is your responsibility, I suggest to use from now Edit mode, so I can see "changes", otherwise you would need to do full review of website <> texts to tell and show me what to change
- Fonts "Didact Gothic" for sans and "Great Vibes" for serif are used
- Keeping 3x "flower dividers" that we had on our website too.
  - I used 3x to not have only 1x to repeat all the time, if you want only one "flower divider" let me know, and I will remove others
- page `/programm` was updated by agenda from the GoogleDoc "–¢–µ–∫—Å—Ç –∑–∞ –≤–µ–± —Å—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—Ü—É"
- fix: `"–ö–∞–¥–∞"` and `"9. –Ω–æ–≤–µ–º–±—Ä–∞ 2025"`
- fix: Title `Marina & Stefan` uses Cyrillic in `sr` locale
- fix: All `sr` locale texts uses Cyrillic
- fix: `Countdown` to use your text
  - after the church wedding ceremony at 12:00, it will switch automatically to
    - SR: `–ø—Ä–æ—à–∞–æ, –æ–Ω–æ —à—Ç–æ —Å–º–æ —Å–µ–±–∏ —Ä–µ–∫–ª–∏ –î–∞`
    - EN: `passed, what we've told ourselves Yes`
