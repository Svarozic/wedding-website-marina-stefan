## TODOs üìì for Stefan


## TODOs üìì for me

- SVARGA: add Logo to navbar without frame,
  - put full logo with flowers and frame on all pages at the bottom (with frame with flowers) instead of divider
- SVARGA: divide Program with parallax, after `Civil wedding at the Villa Jugovo S` create parallax block with waterfall photo `WhatsApp Image 2025-08-10 at 19.34.54.jpeg`
- SVARGA: get Logo from Ivana and use it in Navbar and in Footer
- SVARGA: put drawing of couple stefan marina to HERO, instead of video
- SVARGA: generate `favicon` from logo and use it
- SVARGA: add page `route`
  - it will be like our "Discover slovakia", it meas headline + paragraf + image/google maps with point
- SVARGA: once Website is done, add locale `de`, `ru`
  - [ ] add locales
  - [ ] add GoogleForm links (default to `en`)
- SVARGA: AFTER WEDDING: fix CountdownHeadline, to not have dynamic day countdown, as it can't handle higher number as `99`

## üìì Tasks done

> 07.09.2025

- Color palette: #C62343, #FEBDCA, #91B058, #FF8D7D, #0C88A4
- Add video from Stefan to the index page next to "Lorum Impsum"
- Fix the parallax effect on the index page

> 29.8.2025

- I will create web with `sr`, `en` first, other locales likes `de`, `ru` I will do at the end, when website is finished and texts are final
  - otherwise it would be slowing me down (I already need to do 1x extra copy per text to EN, then I would need to do 3x extra)
  - taking care of `sr` texts and their translations (and keeping it in sync) is your responsibility, I suggest to use from now Edit mode, so I can see "changes", otherwise you would need to do full review of website <> texts to tell and show me what to change
- Fonts "Didact Gothic" for sans and "Great Vibes" for serif are used
- Keeping 3x "flower dividers" that we had on our website too.
  - I used 3x to not have only 1x to repeat all the time, if you want only one "flower divider" let me know, and I will remove others
- itinerary page `/itinerary` was updated by agenda from the GoogleDoc
- fix: `"–ö–∞–¥–∞"` and `"9. –Ω–æ–≤–µ–º–±—Ä–∞ 2025"`
- fix: Title `Marina & Stefan` uses Cyrillic in `sr` locale
- fix: All `sr` locale texts uses Cyrillic
- fix: `Countdown` to use your text
  - after the church wedding ceremony at 12:00, it will switch automatically to
    - SR: `–ø—Ä–æ—à–∞–æ, –æ–Ω–æ —à—Ç–æ —Å–º–æ —Å–µ–±–∏ —Ä–µ–∫–ª–∏ –î–∞`
    - EN: `passed, what we've told ourselves Yes`
